# number-slope
Grid generator for the Number Slope logic puzzle

The program can takes an argument *n*, which gives the size of the grid. E.g. on Windows, type

    python grid_generator.py 6

in the command window to get a 6x6 grid. If you don't provide an argument when you run the program, it will prompt you for a value for *n*.

The program will output a random, completed *n*-by-*n* grid as soon as it finds one. It will also give an update every 500 tries, until it finds a solution or you force-quit the program.

Example output for *n* = 6:

    +---------------+-------+
    | 6   5   4   3 | 1   2 |
    |   +-------+---+       |
    | 2 | 1   5 | 6   4   3 |
    |   |   +---+-------+   |
    | 1 | 2 | 3   4   6 | 5 |
    +---+   +---+       +---+
    | 4   3 | 1 | 2   5 | 6 |
    +---+   |   |   +---+   |
    | 5 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3   4 |
    |   +---+   +---+       |
    | 3   4   6 | 5   2   1 |
    +-----------+-----------+

    70 tries
    Completed in 0 seconds

**Warning**: Don't expect to get a result any time soon for *n* larger than 8.

Command line options:
 - `-tile` generates a tiling of an *n*-by-*n* square with *n* *n*-ominos.
 - `-g N` attempts to generate *N* grids of size *n*-by-*n*, and times the process (default *N* = 1).
 - `-t N` attempts to generate *N* tilings of size *n*-by-*n*, and times the process (default *N* = 100).

The Number Slope logic puzzle (also called *Sukobai*) was first proposed on [Puzzling.StackExchange](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/47723/introducing-number-slope) by Volatility. Taken from there:

**Number Slopeâ„¢** is an original grid deduction puzzle similar to Sudoku. It is solved on an *n*-by-*n* grid, tiled with *n* *n*-ominoes. The rules are:

 - Each number from 1 to *n* must occur once and only once in each row, column, and *n*-omino.
 - Any row or column of adjacent cells *within each* n-*omino* must have numbers which are either increasing or decreasing along the row or column (these are called *slopes*).

That second rule may be a bit confusing, so here is a diagram showing the slopes in an 11-omino and a valid filling:

Here's another diagram, this time giving an example of the solving process for a 3x3 puzzle. The process is quite similar to solving a Sudoku, but note that in step 3 we can deduce how to fill the vertical tromino, since the numbers have to form a slope.
