Grid generator for the Number Slope logic puzzle

The Number Slope logic puzzle (also called *Sukobai*), was first proposed on [Puzzling.StackExchange](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/47723/introducing-number-slope) by Volatility. Taken from there:

**Number Slopeâ„¢** is an original grid deduction puzzle similar to Sudoku. It is solved on an *n*-by-*n* grid, tiled with *n* *n*-ominoes. The rules are:

 - Each number from 1 to *n* must occur once and only once in each row, column, and *n*-omino.
 - Any row or column of adjacent cells *within each* n-*omino* must have numbers which are either increasing or decreasing along the row or column (these are called *slopes*).

That second rule may be a bit confusing, so here is a diagram showing the slopes in an 11-omino and a valid filling:

Here's another diagram, this time giving an example of the solving process for a 3x3 puzzle. The process is quite similar to solving a Sudoku, but note that in step 3 we can deduce how to fill the vertical tromino, since the numbers have to form a slope.
